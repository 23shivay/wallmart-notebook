# 🛒 Walmart Sales Forecasting

This project aims to **analyze and forecast sales for Walmart stores** using historical sales data. Accurate sales forecasting is essential for effective inventory planning, staffing, and promotions, especially for a retail giant like Walmart. The notebook applies data science techniques including EDA (exploratory data analysis), feature engineering, and machine learning models.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Explore sales data across Walmart stores and departments
- Identify trends, seasonality, and the effect of holidays on sales
- Handle missing values and outliers
- Build and evaluate forecasting models to predict future sales
- Draw actionable insights that can help optimize store operations

## 📊 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python** 🐍
- **Jupyter Notebook** 📓
- **Data Manipulation**: `pandas`, `numpy`
- **Data Visualization**: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- **Modeling & Forecasting**: `scikit-learn`, `statsmodels`
